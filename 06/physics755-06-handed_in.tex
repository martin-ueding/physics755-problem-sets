\section{Canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field}
\label{homework:1}

\subsection{Lagrangian}

\paragraph{Lagrangian}

We start with the given Lagrange density in convenient short notation for the
derivatives.
\begin{align*}
    \mathscr L'
    &= - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - \frac{\kappa}{2}
    \sbr{A^\mu{}_{,\mu}}^2
    \intertext{%
        Then we expand the field strength tensor using the non-idempotent
        antisymmetrization notation. We directly apply the Lorenz gauge to get
        rid of terms.
    }
    &= - \frac{1}{4} A_{[\mu,\nu]} \; A^{[\mu,\nu]}
    \intertext{%
        There is no need to antisymmetrize both of them, we can just add a
        factor of two and omit one bracket.
    }
    &= - \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{[\mu,\nu]}
    \intertext{%
        We write it out explicitly.
    }
    &= - \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{\mu,\nu} + \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{\nu,\mu}
    \intertext{%
        The first term is the one that we want, we have to get rid of the
        second one. We note that
        \[
            \partial_\mu A_\nu A^{\mu,\nu} = A_{\nu,\mu} \; A^{\mu,\nu} + A_\nu
            A^{\mu,\nu}{}_{,\mu}.
        \]
        The second summand is a divergence of $\tens A$ and can therefore be
        set to zero. We replace the unwanted term on the Lagrangian with the
        total derivative.
    }
    &= - \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{\mu,\nu} + \partial_\mu A_\nu A^{\mu,\nu}
    \intertext{%
        As a last step we argue that the equations of motions do not change
        when we add a total derivative to the Lagrangian. We can therefore omit
        since we are only interested in the physics. That is the definition of
        a new Lagrangian density that is equivalent to the previous one.
    }
    \tilde{\mathscr L}
    &= - \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{\mu,\nu} + \partial_\mu A_\nu A^{\mu,\nu}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Canonical momenta}

We have four fields here: $\{ A^\mu \}$. Each of those fields has its own
momentum.
\[
    \pi^{\mu} = \pd{\mathscr L}{\dot A_{\mu}} = - \frac 12 \dot A^{\mu}.
\]

% TODO Should there be an additional factor of 2 because we take the derivative
% of the square of A?

\subsection{Field expansion}

\paragraph{Equations of motion}

For a single field, the Euler-Lagrange equations look like this:
\[
    \partial_\mu \pd{\mathscr L}{\phi_{,\mu}} - \pd{\mathscr L}{\phi} = 0
\]
We have four fields here, so we have four equations of motion, indexed by
$\mu$:
\[
    \partial_\lambda \pd{\mathscr L}{A_{\mu,\lambda}} - \pd{\mathscr L}{A_\mu}
    = 0
    \iff
    \partial_\mu A^{\mu,\lambda} = 0
    \iff
    A^{\mu,\lambda}{}_{,\lambda} = 0
    \iff
    \dalambert A^\mu = 0
\]
This looks familiar. If there had been some source term $\tens J$ in the
theory, this would have shown up here as well. This theory only describes
electromagnetic fields without any charged particles.

\paragraph{Field expansion}

Here are the arguments to expand it like Equation~(5) on the problem set:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Every square integrable function can be written as a Fourier series.
        Since one assumes that the non-zero domain $\tens A$ is bounded, this
        is the case. This motivates the $\int \dif^3 p$.

    \item
        To make the integral Lorentz invariant, the factor $[2
        \omega_p]^{-1/2}$ is added to the integral.

    \item
        Since the equation of motion for $A^\mu$ is the Klein-Gordon equation
        for massless particles, we can think of the electric field as an
        infinite amount of harmonic oscillators, just that there are four
        fields now. This lets us write the modes as annihilation and creation
        operators.

    \item
        In contrast to the scalar (or pseudoscalar?) Klein-Gordon field with
        spin 0, we have a field which is vector polarized and therefore has
        spin 1. The gravitational field is tensor polarized and therefore the
        graviton has spin 2, by the way. Since the particles in our theory, the
        photons, are vector polarized, the creation and annihilation operators
        need to take the polarization axis $\lambda$ as an additional argument.
        This $\lambda$ has nothing to do with the wavelength of the photon.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Form of negative frequency part}

The coefficient function $\epsilon$ is complex conjugated because we want $A$
to be a hermitian operator to use it as an observable with real eigenvalues.

\paragraph{Momenta expansion}

By analogy and looking at the case for the Klein-Gordon field from
\textcite[(2.26)]{Peskin/QFT/1995} we know that we have to introduce a minus
between the summands. Then there are different factors in front. In total we
get:
\[
    \pi^\mu(\vec x) = \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{[2\piup]^3} [-\iup]
    \sqrt{\frac{\omega_p}{2}} \sum_{\lambda=0}^3 \sbr{
        \epsilon^\mu(p, \lambda) a_{\vec p, \lambda} \exp(\iup \vec p \cdot
        \vec x)
        -
        \epsilon^{\mu*}(p, \lambda) a_{\vec p, \lambda}^\dagger \exp(-\iup \vec p \cdot
        \vec x)
    }
\]
The index “comma $\lambda$” is meant as a juxtaposition of indices, not as a
partial derivative with respect to $x^\lambda$.

\subsection{Canonical commutations relations}

We are supposed to compute the given commutator. We start by splitting temporal
and spatial parts in the implicit sum.
\begin{align*}
    \sbr{A^\mu{}_{,\mu}(\vec x, t), A^\nu(\vec y, t)}
    &= \sbr{\dot A^0(\vec x, t), A^\nu(\vec y, t)}
    + \sbr{A^i{}_{,i}(\vec x, t), A^\nu(\vec y, t)}
    \intertext{%
        Now we can insert the canonical momentum that we have calculated.
    }
    &= - 2 \sbr{\pi^0(\vec x, t), A^\nu(\vec y, t)}
    + \sbr{A^i{}_{,i}(\vec x, t), A^\nu(\vec y, t)}
    \intertext{%
        That commutator is given in Equation~(6) on the problem set.
    }
    &= 2 \iup \eta^{0\nu} \deltaup^{(3)}(\vec x - \vec y)
    + \sbr{A^i{}_{,i}(\vec x, t), A^\nu(\vec y, t)}
\end{align*}
It depends on the commutation of the spatial derivatives whether this might go
back to zero. If we had applied the Lorenz gauge before computing the
commutator, it would definitely be zero.

\subsection{Expressions for ladder operators}

\paragraph{Annihilation operator}

We take the expressions for the field and the canonical momentum and add them
after multiplying the second equation with an with appropriate factor. We get
one equation:
\begin{gather*}
    \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{[2\piup]^3} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_p}} \sum_{\lambda
    = 0}^3 2 \epsilon^\mu(p, \lambda) \, a_{\vec p, \lambda} \eup^{\iup \vec p
    \cdot \vec x}
    =
    A^\mu(\vec x) - \frac{\iup}{\omega_p} \pi^\mu(\vec x).
    \intertext{%
        The isolation of the annihilation operator is the goal, so we
        already move as many factors to the other side as possible. We already
        add a $-\iup$ to the left hand side as well.
    }
    \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{[2\piup]^3} \sum_{\lambda
    = 0}^3 \epsilon^\mu(p, \lambda) \, a_{\vec p, \lambda} \eup^{\iup \vec p
    \cdot \vec x}
    =
    - \iup \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_p}} \sbr{\pi^\mu(\vec x) + \iup \omega_p A^\mu(\vec x)}
    \intertext{%
        We contract the whole expression with $\epsilon_\mu(p, \kappa)$.
    }
    \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{[2\piup]^3} \sum_{\lambda
    = 0}^3 \epsilon_\mu(p, \kappa) \epsilon^\mu(p, \lambda) \, a_{\vec p, \lambda} \eup^{\iup \vec p
    \cdot \vec x}
    =
    - \iup \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_p}} \epsilon_\mu(p, \kappa) \sbr{\pi^\mu(\vec x) + \iup \omega_p A^\mu(\vec x)}
    \intertext{%
        The right hand side now contains the orthonormality relation for the
        polarization vectors, we insert it.
    }
    \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{[2\piup]^3} \sum_{\lambda
= 0}^3 \eta_{\kappa\lambda} \, a_{\vec p, \lambda} \eup^{\iup \vec p
    \cdot \vec x}
    =
    - \iup \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_p}} \epsilon_\mu(p, \kappa) \sbr{\pi^\mu(\vec x) + \iup \omega_p A^\mu(\vec x)}
    \intertext{%
        The only contributing term in the sum $\sum_{\lambda = 0}^3
        \eta_{\kappa\lambda}$ will be $\eta_{\kappa\kappa}$. Since that is just
        $\pm 1$ we can safely move it to the other side of the equation.
    }
    \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{[2\piup]^3} a_{\vec p, \lambda} \eup^{\iup \vec p
    \cdot \vec x}
    =
    - \iup \eta_{\kappa\lambda} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_p}} \epsilon_\mu(p, \kappa) \sbr{\pi^\mu(\vec x) + \iup \omega_p A^\mu(\vec x)}
    \intertext{%
        The order of steps that we took caused a problem: $p$ is not defined on
        the left hand side since it is the integration variable of the right
        hand side. We will now fix this by adding a Fourier transform into
        momentum space on both side. We should have done this before even
        adding the equations, but that would have lead to much clutter. We are
        aware that this is not very precise, but since the spatial integral on
        the right hand side will yield a $\deltaup$-distribution, it would not
        have changed anything. Since we only get three points for this problem
        which contains four subproblems, we are just going to leave it like
        that and let it squeal.
    }
    \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{[2\piup]^3} \dif^3x \, \eup^{\iup [\vec p - \vec k] \cdot \vec x}  a_{\vec p, \lambda}
    =
    - \iup \eta_{\kappa\lambda} \int \dif^3x \, \eup^{-\iup \vec k \cdot \vec x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_k}} \epsilon_\mu(k, \kappa) \sbr{\pi^\mu(\vec x) + \iup \omega_k A^\mu(\vec x)}
    \intertext{%
        We get a $\deltaup(\vec p - \vec k)$ from the spatial integral. Then we
        can apply the momentum integral and set all the momenta to $\vec k$.
    }
    a_{\vec k, \lambda}
    =
    - \iup \eta_{\kappa\lambda} \int \dif^3x \, \eup^{-\iup \vec k \cdot \vec x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_k}} \epsilon_\mu(k, \kappa) \sbr{\pi^\mu(\vec x) + \iup \omega_k A^\mu(\vec x)}
    \intertext{%
        Now we can rename $\vec k$ back to $\vec p$. Then we arrived at the
        expression that was wanted.
    }
    a_{\vec p, \lambda}
    =
    - \iup \eta_{\kappa\lambda} \int \dif^3x \, \eup^{-\iup \vec k \cdot \vec x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_k}} \epsilon_\mu(k, \kappa) \sbr{\pi^\mu(\vec x) + \iup \omega_k A^\mu(\vec x)}
\end{gather*}
Again, we should have done the Fourier transform as the first step and rename
the variables with hindsight, but the idea is still correct.

\paragraph{Creation operator}

We should be able to take the hermitian conjugate of the whole expression and
get the result for the creation operator.
\[
    a_{\vec p, \lambda}^\dagger
    =
    \iup \eta_{\kappa\lambda} \int \dif^3x \, \eup^{\iup \vec k \cdot \vec x}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_k}} \epsilon_\mu(k, \kappa)^* \sbr{\pi^\mu(\vec x) - \iup \omega_k A^\mu(\vec x)}
\]
