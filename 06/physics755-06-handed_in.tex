\section{Canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field}
\label{homework:1}

\subsection{Lagrangian}

\paragraph{Lagrangian}

We start with the given Lagrange density in convenient short notation for the
derivatives.
\begin{align*}
    \mathscr L'
    &= - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - \frac{\kappa}{2}
    \sbr{A^\mu{}_{,\mu}}^2
    \intertext{%
        Then we expand the field strength tensor using the non-idempotent
        antisymmetrization notation. We directly apply the Lorenz gauge to get
        rid of terms.
    }
    &= - \frac{1}{4} A_{[\mu,\nu]} \; A^{[\mu,\nu]}
    \intertext{%
        There is no need to antisymmetrize both of them, we can just add a
        factor of two and omit one bracket.
    }
    &= - \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{[\mu,\nu]}
    \intertext{%
        We write it out explicitly.
    }
    &= - \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{\mu,\nu} + \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{\nu,\mu}
    \intertext{%
        The first term is the one that we want, we have to get rid of the
        second one. We note that
        \[
            \partial_\mu A_\nu A^{\mu,\nu} = A_{\nu,\mu} \; A^{\mu,\nu} + A_\nu
            A^{\mu,\nu}{}_{,\mu}.
        \]
        The second summand is a divergence of $\tens A$ and can therefore be
        set to zero. We replace the unwanted term on the Lagrangian with the
        total derivative.
    }
    &= - \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{\mu,\nu} + \partial_\mu A_\nu A^{\mu,\nu}
    \intertext{%
        As a last step we argue that the equations of motions do not change
        when we add a total derivative to the Lagrangian. We can therefore omit
        since we are only interested in the physics. That is the definition of
        a new Lagrangian density that is equivalent to the previous one.
    }
    \tilde{\mathscr L}
    &= - \frac{1}{2} A_{\mu,\nu} \; A^{\mu,\nu} + \partial_\mu A_\nu A^{\mu,\nu}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Canonical momenta}

We have four fields here: $\{ A^\mu \}$. Each of those fields has its own
momentum.
\[
    \pi^{\mu} = \pd{\mathscr L}{\dot A_{\mu}} = - \frac 12 \dot A^{\mu}.
\]

% TODO Should there be an additional factor of 2 because we take the derivative
% of the square of A?

\subsection{Field expansion}

\paragraph{Equations of motion}

For a single field, the Euler-Lagrange equations look like this:
\[
    \partial_\mu \pd{\mathscr L}{\phi_{,\mu}} \pd{\mathscr L}{\phi} = 0
\]
We have four fields here, so we have four equations of motion, indexed by
$\mu$:
\[
    \partial_\lambda \pd{\mathscr L}{A_{\mu,\lambda}} - \pd{\mathscr L}{A_\mu}
    = 0
    \iff
    \partial_\mu A^{\mu,\lambda} = 0
    \iff
    A^{\mu,\lambda}{}_{,\lambda} = 0
    \iff
    \dalambert A^\mu = 0
\]
This looks familiar. If there had been some source term $\tens J$ in the
theory, this would have shown up here as well. This theory only describes
electromagnetic fields without any charged particles.

\paragraph{Field expansion}

Here are the arguments to expand it like Equation~(5) on the problem set:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Every square integrable function can be written as a Fourier series.
        Since one assumes that the non-zero domain $\tens A$ is bounded, this
        is the case. This motivates the $\int \dif^3 p$.

    \item
        To make the integral Lorentz invariant, the factor $[2
        \omega_p]^{-1/2}$ is added to the integral.

    \item
        Since the equation of motion for $A^\mu$ is the Klein-Gordon equation
        for massless particles, we can think of the electric field as an
        infinite amount of harmonic oscillators, just that there are four
        fields now. This lets us write the modes as annihilation and creation
        operators.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Form of negative frequency part}

The coefficient function $\epsilon$ is complex conjugated because we want $A$
to be a hermitian operator to use it as an observable with real eigenvalues.

We are not sure why it depends on $p$ and $\lambda$. If $\lambda$ is the
wavelength, then it has a direct correspondence to $p$, so it looks redundant.
Except if we are preparing for off-shell quantities, then it would make sense
to have energy and momentum independent of each other.

\paragraph{Momenta expansion}

By analogy and looking at the case for the Klein-Gordon field from
\textcite[(2.26)]{Peskin/QFT/1995} we know that we have to introduce a minus
between the summands. Then there are different factors in front. In total we
get:
\[
    \pi^\mu(\vec x) = \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{[2\piup]^3} [-\iup]
    \sqrt{\frac{\omega_p}{2}} \sbr{
        \epsilon^\mu(p, \lambda) a_{\vec p, \lambda} \exp(\iup \vec p \cdot
        \vec x)
        -
        \epsilon^{\mu*}(p, \lambda) a_{\vec p, \lambda}^\dagger \exp(-\iup \vec p \cdot
        \vec x)
    }
\]
The index “comma $\lambda$” is meant as a juxtaposition of indices, not as a
partial derivative with respect to $x^\lambda$.
