\section{The S-Matrix}
\label{homework:1}

\subsection{Momentum conservation}

This problem covers the material also shown by \textcite[94 --
95]{Peskin/QFT/1995}.

\paragraph{Momentum conservation at vertex}

Each vertex gives us a factor $- \iup \lambda \int \dif^4 z$, where $\tens z$
is the four-vector for the particular vertex. Each vertex has to have its own
internal integration variable. Then each propagator gives us $D(\tens x - \tens
y)$. Looking at the vertex and all the propagators (labeled with $i$) that end
in this vertex, we get the following term, which we label $A$ to continue
working on it.
\[
    A := - \iup \lambda \int \dif^4 z \, \prod_i D(\tens x_i - \tens z)
\]

To say anything about the momentum, we have to Fourier transform the
propagator. That is given by \textcite[(4.46]{Peskin/QFT/1995} as
\[
    D(\tens x - \tens y) = \int \frac{\dif^4 p}{[2\piup]^4} \frac{\iup}{\tens
    p^2 - m^2 + \iup \epsilon} \exp\del{-\iup \tens p \cdot [\tens x - \tens
    y]}.
\]
We insert this into $A$.
\begin{align*}
    A
    &= - \iup \lambda \int \dif^4 z \, \prod_i \int \frac{\dif^4 p_i}{[2\piup]^4} \frac{\iup}{\tens
    p_i^2 - m^2 + \iup \epsilon} \exp\del{-\iup \tens p_i \cdot [\tens x_i - \tens
    z]}
    \intertext{%
        We can move all the $\tens z$ dependence to the very back of the
        expression to isolate the part which is of interest here.
    }
    &= - \iup \lambda \prod_i \int \frac{\dif^4 p_i}{[2\piup]^4} \frac{\iup}{\tens
    p_i^2 - m^2 + \iup \epsilon}
    \exp(-\iup \tens p_i \cdot \tens x_i)
    \int \dif^4 z \, \exp(\iup \tens p_i \cdot \tens z)
    \intertext{%
        We execute the product for the last term to get the expression that we
        can work with.
    }
    &= - \iup \lambda \sbr{\prod_i \int \frac{\dif^4 p_i}{[2\piup]^4} \frac{\iup}{\tens
        p_i^2 - m^2 + \iup \epsilon}
    \exp(-\iup \tens p_i \cdot \tens x_i)}
    \int \dif^4 z \, \exp\del{\iup \sbr{\sum_i \tens p_i} \cdot \tens z}
    \intertext{%
        This last integral will give us the desired result of a momentum
        conserving $\deltaup$-distribution.
    }
    &= - \iup \lambda \sbr{\prod_i \int \frac{\dif^4 p_i}{[2\piup]^4} \frac{\iup}{\tens
        p_i^2 - m^2 + \iup \epsilon}
    \exp(-\iup \tens p_i \cdot \tens x_i)}
    [2\piup]^4 \deltaup^{(4)}\del{\sum_i \tens p_i}
\end{align*}

Each external line has a factor $\exp(- \iup \tens p \cdot \tens x)$ associated
with it. So this works for external lines just the same as it does for
propagators ending on the vertex.

\paragraph{Overall momentum conservation}

We have momentum conservation in each vertex as derived above. Just like with
Kirchoff's law for the electric current, momentum can be transfered between the
the vertices but is conserved in total.

\paragraph{Fixed internal momenta}

Each propagator brings a momentum with it. If there are too few propagators in
the diagram, everything is fixed. Whenever there is a loop in the diagram,
there is a freedom in momentum there, both can be increased by the same fixed
amount and total momentum is conserved.

\begin{fmffile}{loop}
    \begin{fmfgraph}(100, 40)
        \fmfleft{x}
        \fmfright{y}

        \fmfdot{v1,v2}

        \fmf{fermion}{x,v1}
        \fmf{fermion}{v2,y}
        \fmf{fermion,left,tension=0.7}{v1,v2,v1}
    \end{fmfgraph}
\end{fmffile}

Internal momenta are fixed if there is no closed path that connects vertices.
So if the graph is a tree, all internal momenta are fixed by momentum
conversion.

\subsection{Momentum space Feynman rules}

The number of vertices should still give the order in $\lambda$, so we will
associate the factor of $- \iup \lambda$ with the vertices.

We have seen in the $A$ that the remainder of the propagator is
\[
    \int \frac{\dif^4 p}{[2\piup]^4} \frac{\iup}{\tens
        p^2 - m^2 + \iup \epsilon}
    \exp(-\iup \tens p \cdot \tens x)
\]
It will be convenient to split this up into several parts. The integration over
$\tens p$ becomes a rule that all internal momenta need to be integrated over
in the end. Each propagator gets the fraction assigned. The exponential can be
assigned to the external point connecting the propagator.

This way we can have the same rules that are given by
\textcite[95]{Peskin/QFT/1995}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Each propagator gets a factor
        \[
            \frac{\iup}{\tens p^2 - m^2 + \iup \epsilon}
        \]
        assigned.

    \item
        Each vertex gets just the factor $- \iup \lambda$, which then also
        determines the order of the diagram.

    \item
        Each external point gets the exponential $\exp(-\iup \tens p \cdot
        \tens x)$. This reference to a space-time point is a problem since we
        do not want them here. In a momentum space prescription, there should
        not bet external points to begin with. There should only be incoming
        propagators.

    \item
        Since we derived that total momentum at the vertices is conserved, we
        have to apply the derived $\deltaup$-distribution and assert momentum
        conservation at each of the vertices.

    \item
        All internal momenta have to integrated over.

    \item
        And as before, we need to divide by the symmetry factor.
\end{enumerate}
