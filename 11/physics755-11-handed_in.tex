\section{Muon pair production}
\label{homework:1}

\subsection{Invariant amplitude}

The only contributing diagram is the following (time to the left):

\begin{fmfwrapper}
    \begin{fmffile}{feyn-scatter-1}
        \begin{fmfgraph*}(150, 100)
            \fmfleft{P2,P1}
            \fmfright{K2,K1}
            \fmfdot{v1,v2}

            \fmf{fermion,label=$\tens p_2$}{P2,v1}
            \fmf{fermion,label=$\tens p_1 \circlearrowleft$}{v1,P1}

            \fmf{fermion,label=$\tens k_2$}{v2,K2}
            \fmf{fermion,label=$\tens k_1 \circlearrowleft$}{K1,v2}

            \fmf{photon,label=$\tens q$}{v1,v2}

            \fmflabel{$\mathrm e^-$}{P2}
            \fmflabel{$\mathrm{e^+}$}{P1}
            \fmflabel{$\mathrm{\mu^-}$}{K2}
            \fmflabel{$\mathrm{\mu^+}$}{K1}

            \fmflabel{$\mu$}{v1}
            \fmflabel{$\nu$}{v2}
        \end{fmfgraph*}
    \end{fmffile}
\end{fmfwrapper}

The symbol “$\circlearrowleft$” says that the momentum is direction opposing to
the particle number flow. This was easier than to figure out the direction of
the actual fermion propagator in the FeynMP diagram and choosing an arrow from
the symbols list or creating one with Ti\textit{k}Z. Perhaps one day I will
look into using Ti\textit{k}Z for Feynman diagrams, but I do not want to spend
the time on choosing the positions for the internal vertices by hand.

From this diagram we read off:
\[
    \iup \mathscr M = [- \iup e]^2
    \bar u^{r'}(\tens k_1) \, \mat\gamma^\mu v^r(\tens k_2)
    \frac{1}{[\tens p_1 + \tens p_2]^2}
    \bar v^{s'}(\tens p_1) \, \mat\gamma_\mu u^s(\tens p_2)
\]
The denominator in the photon propagator can be replaced by the Mandelstam
variable $s$. We go on to compute the appropriately averaged sum over squared
amplitudes.
\begin{align*}
    &\frac 14 \sum_{s,s',r,r'} |\iup \mathscr M|^2 \\
    &= \frac 14  \frac{e^4}{s^2} \sum_{s,s',r,r'}

        + M^2 \tens p_1 \cdot \tens p_2

\end{align*}

The actual result should be: \parencite[(5.10)]{Peskin/QFT/1995}
\[
    \frac 14 \sum_\text{spins} |\mathscr M|^2
    = \frac{8 e^4}{q^4} \sbr{
        [\tens p_1 \cdot \tens k_1] [\tens p_2 \cdot \tens k_2]
        + [\tens p_1 \cdot \tens k_2] [\tens p_2 \cdot \tens k_1]
        + M^2 \tens p_1 \cdot \tens p_2
    }.
\]
So we are missing a factor of four.

\subsection{Differential cross section}

The differential cross section in the center of mass system should only depend
on the scattering angle $\theta$ and the energy $E$ each electron brings into
the collision. We again use the center of mass diagram which we reproduced in
Figure~\ref{fig:center_of_mass}.

\begin{figure}[hbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw (0, 0) circle (3);

        \draw[<-, thick] (90:.1) -- (90:3) node[midway, left] {$\vec p_1$};
        \draw[<-, thick] (270:.1) -- (270:3) node[midway, right] {$\vec p_2$};
        \draw[->, thick] (210:.1) -- (210:3) node[midway, above left] {$\vec k_1$};
        \draw[->, thick] (30:.1) -- (30:3) node[midway, above left] {$\vec k_2$};

        \draw[<-] (210:.7) arc (210:270:.7);
        \node at (240:1) {$\theta$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{%
        Scattering of two particles in the center of mass system. Shown are the
        momentum three-vectors. The gap in the center is just for presentation
        purposes.
    }
    \label{fig:center_of_mass}
\end{figure}

From the diagram one can read off the relations between the three-momenta and
compute the following scalar products of the four-momenta.

\begin{itemize}
    \item

        The spatial parts $\vec p_1$ and $\vec p_2$ are the negatives of each
        other. The electrons are assumed to be massless, so the norm of the
        three-momenta is just the energy itself.
        \[
            \tens p_1 \cdot \tens p_2 = E^2 - \vec p_1 \cdot \vec p_2 = 2E^2
        \]

    \item

        Mixed terms will include the scattering angle.
        \[
            \tens k_1 \cdot \tens p_1
            \overset 1= E^2 - |\vec k_1| \, |\vec p_1| \cos(\theta)
            \overset 2= E^2 - E |\vec k_1| \cos(\theta)
            \overset 3= E^2 \sbr{1 - \frac{|\vec k|}{E} \cos(\theta)}
        \]
        About the steps: (1) We have used the definition of the scalar product
        of four-vectors and the angle relation of the three-vector scalar
        product. (2) The norm of the incoming momentum is the energy since we
        assumed the electron to be massless. (3) We factor out $E$. The norms
        of $\vec k_1$ and $\vec k_2$ are the same, so we omit the index when we
        refer to the norm only.

    \item

        Now we look at the other mixed terms. The steps are the same, just that
        the angle is shifted by $\piup$.
        \[
            \tens k_2 \cdot \tens p_1
            = E^2 - |\vec k| \, |\vec p_1| \cos(\theta + \piup)
            = E^2 + E |\vec k| \cos(\theta)
            = E^2 \sbr{1 + \frac{|\vec k|}{E} \cos(\theta)}
        \]
\end{itemize}

We can take those terms to express the invariant matrix element in this
coordinate system. We will use the version from
\textcite[(5.10)]{Peskin/QFT/1995} to have a chance to get the correct answer.
\begin{align*}
    \frac 14 \sum_\text{spins} |\mathscr M|^2

        + [\tens p_1 \cdot \tens k_2] [\tens p_2 \cdot \tens k_1]
        + M^2 \tens p_1 \cdot \tens p_2
    } \\
    &= \frac{8 e^4}{16 E^4} \sbr{
            E^4 \sbr{1 - \frac{|\vec k|}{E} \cos(\theta)}^2
            + E^4 \sbr{1 + \frac{|\vec k|}{E} \cos(\theta)}^2
        + 2 E^2 M^2
    }
    \intertext{%
        We expand the squares. The middle terms will just cancel due to the
        opposing signs.
    }
    &= \frac{e^4}{2 E^4} \sbr{
    2 E^4 +
    2 E^4 \sbr{\frac{|\vec k|}{E} \cos(\theta)}^2
        + 2 E^2 M^2
    } \\
    &= e^4 \sbr{1 + \frac{|\vec k|^2}{E^2} \cos(\theta)^2 + \frac{M^2}{E^2}}
    \intertext{%
        We know that $E^2 = |\vec k^2| + M^2$ and therefore we can write this
        as
    }
    &= e^4 \sbr{1 + \frac{E^2 - M^2}{E^2} \cos(\theta)^2 + \frac{M^2}{E^2}}.
    \intertext{%
        We expand the fraction.
    }
    &= e^4 \sbr{
        1
        + \cos(\theta)^2
        - \frac{M^2}{E^2} \cos(\theta)^2
        + \frac{M^2}{E^2}
    }
    \intertext{%
        Then we can factor out the cosine squared and obtain the result also
        given by \textcite[(5.11)]{Peskin/QFT/1995}.
    }
    &= e^4 \sbr{
    1 + \frac{M^2}{E^2}
    + \sbr{1 - \frac{M^2}{E^2}} \cos(\theta)^2
    }
\end{align*}

From here we can plug this into Equation~(2) given on the problem set and
obtain the differential cross section.
\begin{align*}
    \od{\sigma_\mathrm{cm}}{\cos \theta}
    &= \frac{1}{2 E_\mathrm{cm}^2} \frac{|\vec k|}{16 \piup^2 E_\mathrm{cm}}
    \frac 14 \sum_\text{spins} |\mathscr M|^2 \\
    &= \frac{1}{2 E_\mathrm{cm}^2} \frac{|\vec k|}{16 \piup^2 E_\mathrm{cm}}
    e^4 \sbr{1 + \frac{M^2}{E^2} + \sbr{1 - \frac{M^2}{E^2}} \cos(\theta)^2}
    \intertext{%
        We can simplify the first term a bit.
    }
    &= \frac{e^4}{32 \piup^2 E_\mathrm{cm}^3} \sqrt{E^2 - M^2}

    \intertext{%
        We extract one factor of the energy $E$ out of the square root to make

    \sbr{1 + \frac{M^2}{E^2} + \sbr{1 - \frac{M^2}{E^2}} \cos(\theta)^2}
    \intertext{%
        The relation between single particle energy $E$ and the center of mass

    }
    &= \frac{\alpha^2}{4 E_\mathrm{cm}^2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{M^2}{E^2}}
    \sbr{1 + \frac{M^2}{E^2} + \sbr{1 - \frac{M^2}{E^2}} \cos(\theta)^2}
\end{align*}

This result matched the one given by \textcite[(5.12)]{Peskin/QFT/1995}.

\subsection{Electron muon scattering}

The scattering process looks like this (time to the right):

We now have to group the terms by vertex again. Now it is not the creation and
annihilation that make up a vertex but the electron and a muon coupling to the
exchanged virtual photon. We will keep the assignment of the momenta such that
the electrons are labeled with $\tens p_1$ and $\tens p_2$ and the muons with
$\tens k_1$ and $\tens k_2$. Now we have incoming particles with index 2 and
outgoing particles with index 1.

To give some comparison, here are the invariant matrix elements for both
processes:
\begin{align*}
    \iup \mathscr M_\text{annihilation}
    &= [- \iup e]^2 \,
    \bar u^{r'}(\tens k_1) \, \mat\gamma^\mu v^r(\tens k_2)
    \frac{1}{[\tens p_1 + \tens p_2]^2}
    \bar v^{s'}(\tens p_1) \, \mat\gamma_\mu u^s(\tens p_2) \\
    %
    \iup \mathscr M_\text{scattering}
    &= [- \iup e]^2 \,
    \bar u^{r'}(\tens k_1) \, \mat\gamma_\mu u^r(\tens k_2)
    \frac{1}{[\tens p_1 - \tens p_1]^2}
    \bar u^{s'}(\tens p_1) \, \mat\gamma^\mu u^s(\tens p_2)
\end{align*}

There is only $u$ and no $v$ since we only look at particles and there are no
anti-particles around. The couplings are still the same, the electrons and the
muons never coupled directly to each other. So each vertex only has one lepton
flavor. Since the direction of the momentum have changed, the transfered
momentum $\tens q$ is now the difference of the electron momenta.

This also changes the kinematics which are now shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:center_of_mass2}. The scalar products need to be evaluated
again as the masses changes in the respective terms. In the center of mass
frame the three-momenta of the two incident particles sum to zero. This also
holds true when their mass differs. The energy of the particles is not the
same, however.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        The electrons are massless, so the norm of the momentum is their
        energy.
        \[
            \tens p_1 \cdot \tens p_2
            = E_\eup^2 - |\vec p|^2 \cos(\theta)
            = E_\eup^2 \sbr{1 -  \cos(\theta)}
        \]

    \item
        Similarly, we get the same result for the muon momenta.
        \[
            \tens k_1 \cdot \tens k_2
            = E_\muup^2 \sbr{1 - \cos(\theta)}
        \]

    \item
        The mixed one now indirectly contains the mass $M$ of the muon.
        \[
            \tens k_1 \cdot \tens p_1
            = E_\eup E_\muup - |\vec k_1| \, |\vec p_1| \cos(\piup)
            = E_\eup E_\muup + E_\eup |\vec k|
            = E_\eup E_\muup \sbr{1 + \frac{|\vec k|}{E_\muup}}
        \]
        In the limit $M \to 0$ and with that $|\vec k| \to E_\muup$ this will
        give the same $2E^2$ we had when we looked at the collision of two
        massless electrons.

    \item
        The mixed one now indirectly contains the mass $M$ of the muon.
        \[
            \tens k_1 \cdot \tens p_2
            = E_\eup E_\muup + |\vec k_1| \, |\vec p_2| \cos(\theta)
            = E_\eup E_\muup + E_\eup |\vec k| \cos(\theta)
            = E_\eup E_\muup \sbr{1 + \frac{|\vec k|}{E_\muup} \cos(\theta)}
        \]

\section{Decay of the charged pion}
\label{homework:2}

The diagram given on the problem set looks like time would go in the
\enquote{$\leftarrow$} direction. Every other time direction would mean that
the arrows would go against the particle number flow.

\subsection{Momentum space rule}

The \enquote{diagram equals formula} expression on the problem set probably
means that the vertex has the given form and we are supposed to arrive at this
form.

The perturbation series is build with the Dyson series and the interacting part
of the Hamiltonian. We only have the Lagrangian given, so we would need to
derive the Hamiltonian first. The free Hamiltonian should be same as the
Lagrangian, just with the derivatives of the fields replaced by the momenta.
\[
    H_\text{free} \leadsto \phi^*_{,\mu} \phi^{,\mu} - m_\piup^2 \phi^* \phi
    + \bar\psi [\iup \slashed\partial - m_\muup] \psi 
    + \bar\chi \iup \slashed\partial \chi 
\]
To derive the interaction Hamiltonian we need to compute the canonical momenta
and build up the Hamiltonian from that. The momentum for $\phi$ is
\[
    \pi_\muup^\phi = \phi^*_{,\mu} + \frac{G}{\sqrt 2} f_\piup \sbr{
        \bar\psi \mat\gamma^\mu [1 - \mat\gamma^5] \chi
    }.
\]
When building the Hamiltonian with the pattern
\[
    H = \Upsilon^{,\mu} \pi^\Upsilon_\mu - L
\]
where $\Upsilon \in \{ \psi, \bar\psi, \phi, \phi^*, \chi, \bar\chi \}$, the
interaction term beginning with $G$ will just cancel. At first sight, there is
no interaction in this theory, then.

However, the Hamiltonian lives in the cotangent fiber bundle instead of the
tangent fiber bundle of the states. We need to express terms like
$\phi^*_{,\mu}$ with the momenta and therefore get the interacting term back:
\[
    \phi^*_{,\mu} = \pi_\mu^\phi - \frac{G}{\sqrt 2} f_\piup \sbr{
        \bar\psi \mat\gamma^\mu [1 - \mat\gamma^5] \chi
    }.
\]
The Hamiltonian contains
\[
    \phi^{,\mu} \pi_\mu^\phi + \hc
\]
where we need to replace $\phi^{,\mu}$. We have derived the expression for the
complex conjugate, so we need to insert the complex conjugated of the above
expression. The interacting term should be something along the lines of
\[
    \frac{G}{\sqrt 2} f_\piup \pi_\mu^{\phi} \sbr{
        \bar\psi \mat\gamma^\mu [1 - \mat\gamma^5] \chi
    }^* + \hc \, .
\]

The states that we want to calculate matrix elements with look like
\[
    \bra{\muup^-(\tens k) \, \bar\nuup_\muup(\tens p)} \ldots
    \ket{\piup^-(\tens q)}.
\]
For momentum conservation we need to have $\tens q = \tens k + \tens p$.

The only contractions that are allowed are $\psi$ with the muon, $\chi$ with
the neutrino and $\phi$ with the pion. The $\psi$ and $\bar\psi$ must only be
contracted with incoming particles and antiparticles, respectively. It is the
opposite way when looking at out-states. Since we have an outgoing leptons, we
will need to have $\psi$ and $\bar\chi$ in our interacting term that we can use
in the matrix element.

We might be able to expand all the fields in terms of ladder operators and
expand the states in terms of them as well. Then we would see which
contractions are possible and also get the explicit expression for this matrix
element. Assuming that the rules for the incoming edges are to be the same for
fermions and bosons (that is $u(\tens p)$ and so on for fermions and just 1 for
bosons), we might be able to read off the expression for the vertex.

\subsection{Amplitude for negative pion decay}

We look at the following process:

\begin{fmfwrapper}
    \begin{fmffile}{feyn-decay}
        \begin{fmfgraph*}(150, 100)
            \fmfleft{pi}
            \fmfright{nu,mu}
            \fmfdot{v1}

            \fmf{fermion,label=$\tens k$}{v1,mu}
            \fmf{fermion,label=$\tens p \circlearrowleft$}{nu,v1}

            \fmf{dashes,label=$\tens q$}{pi,v1}

            \fmflabel{$\muup^-$}{mu}
            \fmflabel{$\bar\nuup_\muup$}{nu}
        \end{fmfgraph*}
    \end{fmffile}
\end{fmfwrapper}

Assuming that the vertex gives the factor given on the problem set and the
other rules for fermions do not change, the invariant matrix element is
\[
    \iup \mathscr M =
    \frac{G}{\sqrt 2} f_\piup
    \bar u^{s'}(\tens k) \, [\slashed{\tens p} + \slashed{\tens k}]
    [\mat 1 - \mat\gamma^5] \, v^s(\tens p).
\]
Using this, we can write down the modulus squared and summed over all the
spins. There is no factor to divide by since all the spin states are
out-states.
\begin{align*}
    |\mathscr M|^2
    &= \sum_{s,s'}
    \frac{G^2 f_\piup^2}{2}

\end{align*}

The complex conjugate of a Dirac matrix is not very nice. The application of
the Hermitian conjugate will give a factor $\eta_{\mu\mu}$. For the transpose
or complex conjugate alone there is not such a simple formula. We could save
ourselves (or make it worse) by going back to the formula of complex
conjugation of a bilinear and argue that the hermitian conjugate should have
been used all the way. This would introduce this factor $\eta_{\mu\mu}$ which
would also be a problem. So we are not really sure how to deal with this.

Other than that, we would look at the two terms we get from expanding the
projection operator. The first term without $\mat\gamma^5$ would vanish since
it contains an odd number of Dirac matrices (except for the complex conjugated
Dirac matrices, which might change the whole thing). Then we can tend to the
remaining term and write $\slashed{\tens p} = p_\mu \mat\gamma^\mu$ and pull
the component $p_\mu$ out of the trace since the trace is linear in its
argument. Then we would be left with something where we can use the trace
identity with.

\subsection{Lifetime}

Well, we cannot do this because we are missing the result from the previous
problem. If we had, we would plug it into Equation~(5) from the problem set. We
would need to integrate the resulting expression over the whole solid angle
