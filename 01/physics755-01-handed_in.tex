\section{The complex scalar field}

\subsection{Hamiltonian}

\paragraph{Conjugate momenta}

I have given the following action:
\[
    S = \int \dif^4 x \, \sbr{
        \partial_\mu \phi^* \partial^\mu \phi - m^2 \phi^* \phi
    }.
\]
The scoping of the $\partial$ is not perfectly clear, I assume that it will
only act on the symbol directly after it. So that the first term in the action
density is the four-gradient squared. I will use GR notation for that:
\[
    S = \int \dif^4 x \, \sbr{
        \phi^*_{,\mu} \phi^{,\mu} - m^2 \phi^* \phi
    }.
\]

Now I use
\[
    S = \int \dif t \, L
    \eqnsep
    L = \int \dif^3 x \, \mathscr L
\]
where $\mathscr L$ is the Lagrange density and obtain the Lagrange function
$L$:
\[
    L = \int \dif^3 x \, \sbr{
        \phi^*_{,\mu} \phi^{,\mu} - m^2 \phi^* \phi
    }.
\]

The conjugate momentum densities are then:
\[
    \pi = \pd{L}{\dot \phi} = \dot \phi^{*}
    \eqnsep
    \pi^* = \pd{L}{\dot \phi^*} = \dot \phi.
\]

\paragraph{Commutation relations}

The commutation relations are chosen in a certain way to quantize the theory. I
do not think there is anything one can do to derive them right here. The
relations are, with $a$ and $b$ labelling multiple fields
\parencite[(12.3.1)]{Schwabl/Quantenmechanik_fuer_Fortgeschrittene/2008}:
\begin{gather*}
    \sbr{\phi_a(x, t), \pi_b(y, t)} = \iup \delta_{ab} \delta(x - y) \\
    \sbr{\phi_a(x, t), \phi_b(y, t)} = 0 \\
    \sbr{\pi_a(x, t), \pi_b(y, t)} = 0
\end{gather*}

Now one can insert the momenta and yield
\begin{gather*}
    \sbr{\phi(x, t), \dot\phi^*(y, t)} = \iup \delta_{ab} \delta(x - y) \\
    \sbr{\phi^*(x, t), \dot\phi(y, t)} = \iup \delta_{ab} \delta(x - y)
\end{gather*}
by also setting $\phi_a := \phi$ and $\phi_b := \phi^*$
\parencite[(13.2.4)]{Schwabl/Quantenmechanik_fuer_Fortgeschrittene/2008}.

\paragraph{Hamiltonian}

The Hamiltonian can then be obtained using a Legendre transformation. I have
not an explicit recipe for the complex valued case since
\textcite[Chapter~2]{Peskin/QFT/1995} only cover the real Klein-Gordon field
and \textcite[Chapter~13.2]{Schwabl/Quantenmechanik_fuer_Fortgeschrittene/2008}
does not give the Hamiltonian of the complex Klein-Gordon field. I figured out
a way that gives the correct result. Please tell me whether it is the correct
reasoning.

The Legendre transformation in classical mechanics is
\[
    H = \pi_i \dot q^i - L.
\]
The $i$ denote the finite number of degrees of freedom. In a field theory, the
degrees of freedoms are infinite, and therefore one has $q_i \to q(x)$ and $x$
labels the degrees of freedom. Now $q(x)$ is the \emph{one} field in
consideration. There is a momentum $\pi(x)$ which also has the same degrees of
freedom. There still has to be a sum over all the degrees of freedom, which is
now done by integration over $x$.
\[
    H = \int \dif x \, \pi(x) \dot q(x) - L.
\]

Here we have two fields, $\phi$ and $\phi^*$. Therefore, there are multiple
terms in the Hamiltonian. The equation looks really similar:
\[
    H = \int \dif x \, \pi_a(x) \dot \phi^a(x) - L.
\]
Here, the index $a$ numbers the different fields ($a = 1, 2$) like you (R.\,L.)
did in the exercise class on 2015-04-17. So the index summation is over the
different fields. The summing over $i$ is now an integral over $x$.

With this, I can find the Hamiltonian:
\begin{align*}
    H
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{\pi \dot \phi + \pi^* \dot\phi^* - \mathscr L(\phi, \dif \phi(\phi,
    \pi))} \\
    \intertext{%
        Before I insert $\mathscr L$, I will replace the time derivative of the
        fields with the canonical momentum density. This will also make the
        first two summands equal, since the momenta commute.
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{2 \pi^* \pi - \mathscr L} \\
    \intertext{%
        Now I expand $\mathscr L$.
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{2 \pi^* \pi - \phi^*_{,\mu} \phi^{,\mu} +
    m^2 \phi^* \phi} \\
    \intertext{%
        Using the metric tensor $\eta^{ii} = -1$ one can separate time and
        spatial components:
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{2 \pi^* \pi - \sbr{\dot \phi^* \dot \phi - \vnabla \phi^* \cdot
    \vnabla \phi} + m^2 \phi^* \phi} \\
    \intertext{%
        The first term in the inner bracket is just $\pi^* \pi$ and cancels out
        part of the first summand. I am left with
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{ \pi^* \pi + \vnabla \phi^* \cdot \vnabla \phi + m^2 \phi^* \phi}.
\end{align*}
This is exactly the Hamiltonian given in Equation~(7) on the problem set.

\paragraph{Heisenberg equations of motion}

Now that the Hamiltonian is derived, one can use the time evolution in the
Heisenberg picture to get the equations of motion for the two fields. This is
plugging in into
\(
    \iup \dot O = [H, O]
\)
for given operator $O$ \parencite[(2.44)]{Peskin/QFT/1995}. I can insert $O =
\phi$ and $O = \pi$ to get the Hamiltonian equations of motions. I will start
with the $\phi(\vec x, t)$.
\begin{align*}
    \iup \dot\phi(\vec x, t)
    &= \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), H} \\
    \intertext{%
        I insert the Hamiltonian. The integration has to be done over a
        different variable, I use $x'$. All the functions in the Hamiltonian
        have arguments $(\vec x', t)$ which I omitted to fit this onto a single
        line.
    }
    &= \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t),
        \int \dif^3 x' \sbr{ \pi^* \pi + \vnabla \phi^* \cdot \vnabla \phi + m^2 \phi^* \phi}
    } \\
    \intertext{%
        The integration of $\vec x'$ does not involve $\vec x$ at all, so I can
        use the linearity of the integral and move it out of the commutator. I
        now have three individual ones I can work with independently.
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x' \sbr{
        \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), \pi^* \pi}
        + \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), \vnabla \phi^* \cdot \vnabla \phi}
        + m^2 \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), \phi^* \phi}
    }
    \intertext{%
        (1) In the first term, $\phi$ commutes with $\pi^*$, so I can move this
        out of the commutator. (2) The $\phi$ commute with each other freely,
        so this commutator is just zero. (3) $\phi$ commutes with itself at any
        time, so this is also zero. What remains is
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x' \, \pi^* \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), \pi(\vec x', t)}.
    \intertext{%
        Using the commutation relations that I copied earlier, this can be
        written as
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x' \, \pi^*(\vec x', t) \, \iup \, \deltaup(\vec x - \vec x')
    \intertext{%
        Now I perform the integration and obtain
    }
    &= \iup \pi^*(\vec x, t).
\end{align*}
This looks similar to the treatment of the real Klein-Gordon field by
\textcite[25]{Peskin/QFT/1995}. The time evolution of the complex conjugate
$\phi^*$ is given by $\pi(\vec x, t)$ as this whole derivation can be complex
conjugated ($H^* = H$).

Now I need to perform an analogue calculation for $\dot\pi$:
\begin{align*}
    \iup \dot\pi(\vec x, t)
    &= \sbr{\pi(\vec x, t), } \\
    &= \sbr{\pi(\vec x, t),
        \int \dif^3 x' \sbr{ \pi^* \pi + \vnabla \phi^* \cdot \vnabla \phi + m^2 \phi^* \phi}
    } \\
    \intertext{%
        Again I move the integration out of the commutator and yield three
        independent ones:
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x' \sbr{
        \sbr{\pi(\vec x, t), \pi^* \pi}
        + \sbr{\pi(\vec x, t), \vnabla \phi^* \cdot \vnabla \phi}
        + m^2 \sbr{\pi(\vec x, t), \phi^* \phi}
    }
    \intertext{%
        The commutators are now different from the previous case with $\phi$.
        (1) This commutator is zero, since the momentum density commutes with
        itself at any point in time. (2) This will need partial integration to
        isolate $\phi$ which does not commute with $\pi$. (3) The last term is
        like the first term of the previous derivation.
    }
    &= \eval{\vnabla \phi^* \sbr{\pi(\vec x, t), \phi}}_{\vec x' = \partial
\R^3} + \int \dif^3 x' \sbr{
        - \laplace \phi^* \sbr{\pi(\vec x, t), \phi}
        + m^2 \phi^* \sbr{\pi(\vec x, t), \phi(\vec x', t)}
    }
    \intertext{%
        (1) The surface term in front will vanish on the boundary at infinity
        because everything is assumed to be normalizable and must therefore
        decay faster than $1/\sqrt r$. I will drop that term. (2) The
        commutator is the negative of the commutation relation given before.
        (3) That term is now the same as the second term and I will factor that
        out.
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x' \sbr{\laplace \phi^* - m^2 \phi^*}
    \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), \pi(\vec x, t)}
    \intertext{%
        That last remaining commutator gives a $\deltaup$-distribution again. I
        integrate over it to remove the $\vec x'$ and I obtain
    }
    &= [\laplace - m^2]\phi^*(\vec x, t).
\end{align*}
This also looks similar to the results of \textcite[25]{Peskin/QFT/1995}.

\paragraph{Klein-Gordon equation}

Both of those results have to be combined to give the equation of motion for
the field $\phi$. Taking the time derivative of the first equation and
inserting the second yields
\[
    \ddot \phi(\vec x, t) = [\laplace - m^2] \phi(\vec x, t).
\]
as well as the complex conjugate of this equation. This indeed is the
classical Klein-Gordon equation \parencite[(2.7)]{Peskin/QFT/1995} and the
quantum mechanical one \parencite[(2.45)]{Peskin/QFT/1995}.

\subsection{Fourier modes}

\paragraph{Expand into Fourier modes}

I will go along the lines of \textcite[§\,2.3]{Peskin/QFT/1995} here. The
expansion of $\phi$ and $\pi$ into Fourier modes is formally given by:
\[
    \phi(\vec x, t) = \int \frac{\dif^3p}{[2\piup]^3} \exp(\iup \vec p \vec x)
    \phi(\vec p, t).
\]
This is just the back-transform from the momentum space into spatial space (is
that even a word?). The real task is to find a representation for $\phi(\vec p,
t)$. In momentum space, the Klein-Gordon equation looks just like the equation
of the harmonic oscillator \parencite[(2.21)]{Peskin/QFT/1995}. The field and
the momentum can then be written with ladder operators in analogy and the
harmonic oscillator
\parencite[(2.23)]{Peskin/QFT/1995}:
\[
    \phi = \frac{1}{2 \omega} [a + a^\dagger]
    \eqnsep
    p = - \iup \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2}} [a - a^\dagger]
    \eqnsep
    \omega := \sqrt{|\vec p|^2 + m^2}.
\]

\begin{question}
    Why can I do this? Is it because the Hamiltonian looks like the one from
    the harmonic oscillator and one now thinks about the Klein-Gordan field as
    a field made up of an infinite number of harmonic oscillators? Is that why
    \textcite[(2.25)]{Peskin/QFT/1995} then use $a_{\vec p}$ next, because that
    creates another harmonic oscillator with momentum $\vec p$?
\end{question}

I repeat the expansion of the field into Fourier modes:
\begin{align*}
    \phi(\vec x, t)
    &= \int \frac{\dif^3p}{[2\piup]^3} \exp(\iup \vec p \vec x) \phi(\vec p, t).
    \intertext{%
        Now I insert the ladder operators. I have not understood why the last
        exponential has a minus sign in it. It looks like the second summand is
        the Hermitean conjugate of the first one. This makes $\phi$
        self-adjoint and therefore real. \textcite[§\,2.3]{Peskin/QFT/1995}
        cover the real Klein-Gordon field, so I am not sure whether this is
        correct here as well. According to
        \textcite[§\,13.2]{Schwabl/Quantenmechanik_fuer_Fortgeschrittene/2008}
        this is not correct here and I have to use independent operators for
        creation and annihilation. The complex conjugate field will then have
        the order reversed. I will use the notation and call the second set of
        ladder operators $b$. \textcite{Peskin/QFT/1995} in contrast to
        \textcite{Schwabl/Quantenmechanik_fuer_Fortgeschrittene/2008} have the
        minus sign at different positions as well. I will stick with the latter
        one since that really is for the relativistic Klein-Gordan field.
    }
    \phi(\vec x, t)
    &= \int \frac{\dif^3p}{[2\piup]^3}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \omega_{\vec p}}} \sbr{
        a_{\vec p} \exp(- \iup \vec p \vec x)
        + b_{\vec p}^\dagger \exp(\iup \vec p \vec x)
    }
    \intertext{%
        Since the integral is symmetric in $\vec p$, one can factor out the
        exponential by using $-\vec p$ in those parts.
    }
    \phi(\vec x, t)
    &= \int \frac{\dif^3p}{[2\piup]^3}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \omega_{\vec p}}} \sbr{
        a_{-\vec p}
        + b_{\vec p}^\dagger
    } \exp(\iup \vec p \vec x)
    \intertext{%
        The complex conjugate, or rather the Hermitian conjugate of this
        expression can now be computed to give the other part.
    }
    \phi^*(\vec x, t)
    &= \int \frac{\dif^3p}{[2\piup]^3}
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \omega_{\vec p}}} \sbr{
        b_{-\vec p}
        + a_{\vec p}^\dagger
    } \exp(\iup \vec p \vec x)
\end{align*}

The same thing can then be done for the momentum densities as well:
\begin{align*}
    \pi(\vec x, t)
    &= - \iup \int \frac{\dif^3p}{[2\piup]^3} \sqrt{\frac{\omega_{\vec p}}{2}}
    \sbr{a_{- \vec p} - b_{\vec p}^\dagger} \exp(\iup \vec p \vec x) \\
    \pi^*(\vec x, t)
    &= - \iup \int \frac{\dif^3p}{[2\piup]^3} \sqrt{\frac{\omega_{\vec p}}{2}}
    \sbr{b_{- \vec p} - a_{\vec p}^\dagger} \exp(\iup \vec p \vec x)
\end{align*}

\begin{small}
    The real number constant $\piup$ and the momentum density $\pi$ can be told
    apart since the former is in upright font whereas the latter is in italic
    font. This is done according to ISO standard 80000-2
    \parencite{iso_80000-2:2009}.
\end{small}

\paragraph{Hamilton operator in ladder operators}

The next step is to take those four expressions derived here and build up the
Hamilton operator with them. The last version that I had for the Hamiltonian
was the following:
\begin{align*}
    H
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{\pi^* \pi + \vnabla \phi^* \cdot \vnabla \phi + m^2 \phi^* \phi}.
    \intertext{%
        Now I insert all the four expressions into there. It is crucial to
        choose different integration variables in the products since those are
        independent of each other. In the following I just replaced everything
        with the Fourier expansions, nothing is reordered yet.

    \\&\qquad

\end{align*}

\subsection{Symmetry}

In all terms only $X^*X = |X|^2$ comes up. A constant phase factor would cancel
out in those and therefore not change the action, Lagrangian or the
Hamiltonian. The field and its derivatives and therefore the coordinates would
change. But the equations of motions would retain their form.
