\section{The complex scalar field}

\subsection{Hamiltonian}

\paragraph{Conjugate momenta}

I have given the following action:
\[
    S = \int \dif^4 x \, \sbr{
        \partial_\mu \phi^* \partial^\mu \phi - m^2 \phi^* \phi
    }.
\]
The scoping of the $\partial$ is not perfectly clear, I assume that it will
only act on the symbol directly after it. So that the first term in the action
density is the four-gradient squared. I will use GR notation for that:
\[
    S = \int \dif^4 x \, \sbr{
        \phi^*_{,\mu} \phi^{,\mu} - m^2 \phi^* \phi
    }.
\]

Now I use
\[
    S = \int \dif t \, L
    \eqnsep
    L = \int \dif^3 x \, \mathscr L
\]
where $\mathscr L$ is the Lagrange density and obtain the Lagrange function
$L$:
\[
    L = \int \dif^3 x \, \sbr{
        \phi^*_{,\mu} \phi^{,\mu} - m^2 \phi^* \phi
    }.
\]

The conjugate momentum densities are then:
\[
    \pi = \pd{L}{\dot \phi} = \dot \phi^{*}
    \eqnsep
    \pi^* = \pd{L}{\dot \phi^*} = \dot \phi.
\]

\paragraph{Commutation relations}

The commutation relations are chosen in a certain way to quantize the theory. I
do not think there is anything one can do to derive them right here. The
relations are, with $a$ and $b$ labelling multiple fields
\parencite[(12.3.1)]{Schwabl/Quantenmechanik_fuer_Fortgeschrittene/2008}:
\begin{gather*}
    \sbr{\phi_a(x, t), \pi_b(y, t)} = \iup \delta_{ab} \delta(x - y) \\
    \sbr{\phi_a(x, t), \phi_b(y, t)} = 0 \\
    \sbr{\pi_a(x, t), \pi_b(y, t)} = 0
\end{gather*}

Now one can insert the momenta and yield
\begin{gather*}
    \sbr{\phi(x, t), \dot\phi^*(y, t)} = \iup \delta_{ab} \delta(x - y) \\
    \sbr{\phi^*(x, t), \dot\phi(y, t)} = \iup \delta_{ab} \delta(x - y)
\end{gather*}
by also setting $\phi_a := \phi$ and $\phi_b := \phi^*$
\parencite[(13.2.4)]{Schwabl/Quantenmechanik_fuer_Fortgeschrittene/2008}.

\paragraph{Hamiltonian}

The Hamiltonian can then be obtained using a Legendre transformation. I have
not an explicit recipe for the complex valued case since
\textcite[Chapter~2]{Peskin/QFT/1995} only cover the real Klein-Gordon field
and \textcite[Chapter~13.2]{Schwabl/Quantenmechanik_fuer_Fortgeschrittene/2008}
does not give the Hamiltonian of the complex Klein-Gordon field. I figured out
a way that gives the correct result. Please tell me whether it is the correct
reasoning.

The Legendre transformation in classical mechanics is
\[
    H = \pi_i \dot q^i - L.
\]
The $i$ denote the finite number of degrees of freedom. In a field theory, the
degrees of freedoms are infinite, and therefore one has $q_i \to q(x)$ and $x$
labels the degrees of freedom. Now $q(x)$ is the \emph{one} field in
consideration. There is a momentum $\pi(x)$ which also has the same degrees of
freedom. There still has to be a sum over all the degrees of freedom, which is
now done by integration over $x$.
\[
    H = \int \dif x \, \pi(x) \dot q(x) - L.
\]

Here we have two fields, $\phi$ and $\phi^*$. Therefore, there are multiple
terms in the Hamiltonian. The equation looks really similar:
\[
    H = \int \dif x \, \pi_a(x) \dot \phi^a(x) - L.
\]
Here, the index $a$ numbers the different fields ($a = 1, 2$) like you (R.\,L.)
did in the exercise class on 2015-04-17. So the index summation is over the
different fields. The summing over $i$ is now an integral over $x$.

With this, I can find the Hamiltonian:
\begin{align*}
    H
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{\pi \dot \phi + \pi^* \dot\phi^* - \mathscr L(\phi, \dif \phi(\phi,
    \pi))} \\
    \intertext{%
        Before I insert $\mathscr L$, I will replace the time derivative of the
        fields with the canonical momentum density. This will also make the
        first two summands equal, since the momenta commute.
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{2 \pi^* \pi - \mathscr L} \\
    \intertext{%
        Now I expand $\mathscr L$.
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{2 \pi^* \pi - \phi^*_{,\mu} \phi^{,\mu} +
    m^2 \phi^* \phi} \\
    \intertext{%
        Using the metric tensor $\eta^{ii} = -1$ one can separate time and
        spatial components:
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{2 \pi^* \pi - \sbr{\dot \phi^* \dot \phi - \vnabla \phi^* \cdot
    \vnabla \phi} + m^2 \phi^* \phi} \\
    \intertext{%
        The first term in the inner bracket is just $\pi^* \pi$ and cancels out
        part of the first summand. I am left with
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x \sbr{ \pi^* \pi + \vnabla \phi^* \cdot \vnabla \phi + m^2 \phi^* \phi}.
\end{align*}
This is exactly the Hamiltonian given in Equation~(7) on the problem set.

\paragraph{Heisenberg equation of motion}

Now that the Hamiltonian is derived, one can use the time evolution in the
Heisenberg picture to get the equations of motion for the two fields. This is
plugging in into
\(
    \iup \dot O = [H, O]
\)
for given operator $O$ \parencite[(2.44)]{Peskin/QFT/1995}. I can insert $O =
\phi$ and $O = \pi$ to get the Hamiltonian equations of motions. I will start
with the $\phi(\vec x, t)$.
\begin{align*}
    \iup \dot\phi(\vec x, t)
    &= \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), H} \\
    \intertext{%
        I insert the Hamiltonian. The integration has to be done over a
        different variable, I use $x'$. All the functions in the Hamiltonian
        have arguments $(\vec x', t)$ which I omitted to fit this onto a single
        line.
    }
    &= \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t),
        \int \dif^3 x' \sbr{ \pi^* \pi + \vnabla \phi^* \cdot \vnabla \phi + m^2 \phi^* \phi}
    } \\
    \intertext{%
        The integration of $\vec x'$ does not involve $\vec x$ at all, so I can
        use the linearity of the integral and move it out of the commutator. I
        now have three individual ones I can work with independently.
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x' \sbr{
        \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), \pi^* \pi}
        + \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), \vnabla \phi^* \cdot \vnabla \phi}
        + m^2 \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), \phi^* \phi}
    }
    \intertext{%
        (1) In the first term, $\phi$ commutes with $\pi^*$, so I can move this
        out of the commutator. (2) The $\phi$ commute with each other freely,
        so this commutator is just zero. (3) $\phi$ commutes with itself at any
        time, so this is also zero. What remains is
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x' \, \pi^* \sbr{\phi(\vec x, t), \pi(\vec x', t)}.
    \intertext{%
        Using the commutation relations that I copied earlier, this can be
        written as
    }
    &= \int \dif^3 x' \, \pi^*(\vec x', t) \, \iup \, \deltaup(\vec x - \vec x')
    \intertext{%
        Now I perform the integration and obtain
    }
    &= \iup \pi^*(\vec x, t).
\end{align*}
This looks similar to the treatment of the real Klein-Gordon field by
\textcite[25]{Peskin/QFT/1995}.

\subsection{Fourier modes}

\subsection{Symmetry}

In all terms only $X^*X = |X|^2$ comes up. A constant phase factor would cancel
out in those and therefore not change the Action, Lagrangian or the
Hamiltonian. The field and its derivatives and therefore the coordinates would
change. But the equations of motions would retain their form.
